## ROCK OR MINE CLASSIFICATION USING MACHINE LEARNING

### BINARY CLASSIFICATION

### About Dataset
There is a war going on between two countries. Submarine of a country is going under the water to another country and enemy country planted some mines in the oceans. Mines are nothing but explosive that explodes when some object comes in contact with it and there can be rocks in the ocean so submarine needs to predict whether it is crossing mine or rock. Our job is to make a system that can predict whether the object beneath the submarine is a mine or a rock. So how this is done is submarine uses sonar signal that sends sound and receives switchbacks. So this signal is processed to detect whether the object is a mine or it's just a rock in the ocean. To predict the rock and mine we use some types of algorithms like decision tree, KNeighbors, Logistic Regression, Random Forrest and GradientBoosting.
